**This page is a work in progress for my portfolio**

I am Nick Skinner, an engineer passionite about robotics and advancing the tecnologies of today's society. My work as a Systems Engineer and embedded engineering has allowed me to learn skills ranging from product design to embedded coding and hardware design. I am capable of traversing the tree from product conception/voice of customer to end stages of the product release cycle. My passions have also lead to me taking on project around robotics machine perception and navigation algorithms, as seen in blogs-to-come about my Ardak project.

Many of my personal projects are developed ad-hoc, in whatever way I might need for learning a new skill or just having fun! Feel free to talk to me any time about robotics controls and how I've used them to learn complex algorithms and control theory.

#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
